# TrafficHazardsApp
This is the repository for our final Android Project

This project is an android application that will allow users to create posts and upload photos of any traffic hazards they encounter on the road
Users will be able to upload a photo and description of the traffic hazard to the app, which will be pushed to firebase. Similarly, any users that log on
will be able to see all traffic hazards that have been posted
